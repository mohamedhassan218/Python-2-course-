# Python 2 Course

This was my first time to write code and push it to GitHub. This code in this repo was some simple projects from Python 2 [Course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python) from CodeCademy.

`Projects 1.py` contains a simple battleship game implemented with the basics of Python like loops, if-conditions and print statements.

`Projects 2.py` contians another set of simple code to solidify the basics of Python. There names are:
- PygLatin.
- Taking a vication.
- Student becomes the teacher.
- Exam statistics.


Feel free to take the code, customize it and try different ideas.
